# cognito-example

A basic NODEJS example of a working connection to AgriPlace Chain.

The application has two sections, one which shows how to get a valid application session using aws-cognito and one which shows a very simple HTTPS request which uses the token to get the matching suppliers based on searching the GGN property of a supplier.

# How to run

```
    node index.js
```
